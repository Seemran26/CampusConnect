# CampusConnect

This project is a web application designed to help students find colleges. The application features a front-end developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a back-end powered by Node.js. The server is managed using XAMPP, and MySQL is used for the database. Development is done in Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (for Apache and MySQL)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, but useful for version control)

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup XAMPP

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL services.

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code (you can use Git Bash or the integrated terminal).
3. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
4. Install the necessary Node.js libraries:
   
    ```bash
   npm install

5. Start the Node.js server using nodemon:
    ```bash
   nodemon app.js


### 3. Frontend Setup
1. In Visual Studio Code, open the frontend directory.
2. Install the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code if you havenâ€™t already.
3. Start Live Server by right-clicking on your index.html file and selecting "Open with Live Server".

###Project Structure
- frontend/ - Contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the client-side.
- server/ - Contains the Node.js backend code.
- app.js - The main file where the Node.js server is defined.
- package.json - Lists Node.js dependencies and scripts.

###Dependencies
- Node.js Dependencies
- express - Web framework for Node.js.
- mysql - MySQL client for Node.js.
- nodemon - Tool for automatically restarting the server.
- Install these dependencies in the server directory using:
  
    ```bash
      npm install express mysql nodemon

### Note: For the application to work correctly, you need to run the servers for each webpage individually (college, college_list, exams). When one server is running, you must close the terminal in Visual Studio Code before starting another.
